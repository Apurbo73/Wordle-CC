Sure! Here's a **step-by-step explanation** of the C++ code that solves the modified Wordle problem:

---

### ðŸ”¢ **Problem Recap**

You're given:

* A **hidden word** `S` (like the real word in Wordle),
* A **guess word** `T` (the player's guess),
* Both are 5 letters long.

You have to compare them **character by character**, and generate a new string `M` of length 5:

* `G` (for "Good") if the letter in the guess is **correct** and in the **correct position**.
* `B` (for "Bad") if the letter in the guess is **incorrect** or in the **wrong position**.

---

### âœ… **Code Breakdown**

```cpp
#include <iostream>   // For input and output
using namespace std;
```

* Includes necessary header for input/output and uses the standard namespace.

---

```cpp
int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;
```

* Reads the number of test cases `T`.

---

```cpp
    while (T--) {
```

* A loop that runs `T` times (one for each test case).

---

```cpp
        string S, T;
        cin >> S >> T;
        string M = "";
```

* Reads two 5-letter strings:

  * `S` = the hidden word,
  * `T` = the guess word.
* Initializes an empty string `M` which will hold the result (like "GGBBG").

---

```cpp
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            if (S[i] == T[i]) {
                M += 'G';
            } else {
                M += 'B';
            }
        }
```

* Loops over each of the 5 characters.
* Compares the characters at the same index (`i`) in both strings:

  * If they match, appends `'G'` to `M`.
  * If not, appends `'B'`.

---

```cpp
        cout << M << endl;
    }
```

* After finishing the comparison, prints the resulting `M` string for that test case.

---

```cpp
    return 0;
}
```

* Standard return statement for the `main` function.

---

### ðŸ§ª **Example**

Input:

```
1
HELLO
HEART
```

Steps:

* Compare `H` with `H` â†’ G
* Compare `E` with `E` â†’ G
* Compare `L` with `A` â†’ B
* Compare `L` with `R` â†’ B
* Compare `O` with `T` â†’ B

Output:

```
GGBBB
```

Let me know if you want this turned into a [flowchart](f), [commented version of the code](f), or a [practice version with sample input/output](f).
